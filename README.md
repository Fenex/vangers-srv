## Vangers-Srv

Vangers-Srv is a reimplementated of the Vangers Server published by KranX. Its written in pure Rust without any unsafe features and uses tokio as async runtime.

Vangers-Srv is under active development and, unfortunately, is not full-compatible with original protocol, at least, for now. Additionally, the server hasn't all features that implemented by original server (for example, total player ratings are missed).
However, the server is playable and you can play with your friends using any Vangers game client (Steam, GOG or your own compiled from source).

`Vangers-Srv` running on `fenex.vangers.net:2197`.
